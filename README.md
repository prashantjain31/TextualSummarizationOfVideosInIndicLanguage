### Project: Textual Summarization Of Videos in Indic Languages

---

#### Description:
This project aims to provide textual summarization of videos in Indic languages using various technologies and APIs.

---

#### Backend Application:
The backend application (`app.py`) is written in Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. All the required functions for summarization are present in the `main.py` file.

---

#### Technologies and APIs Used:
- **Summarization**: We are using ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, a state-of-the-art natural language processing model developed by OpenAI, for the summarization portion.
- **Translation**: For translation, we are utilizing Bhashini APIs to facilitate translation of text into Indic languages.
- **Text-to-Speech Translation**: For text-to-speech translation, we are employing gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API.

#### How to Run the Backend:
Follow these steps to run the backend:

1. **Clone the Backend Branch**: Clone the backend branch of the repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. **Set Up API Keys and Authorization Tokens**: Open the `main.py` file and input your OpenAI API key and Bhashini's authorization token in the appropriate placeholders.

4. **Run the Application**: Once the dependencies are installed and API keys are set up, run the Flask application by executing the following command: `python app.py`
